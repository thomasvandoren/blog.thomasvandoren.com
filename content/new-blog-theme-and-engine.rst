Today I finally finished converting my blog from `WordPress`_ to `Pelican`_. I
have been meaning to do this for quite some time. I didn't really have any
problems with WordPress, I just don't want to deal with a service anymore and
static site generators now provide all the functionality I need. In fact, the
fact that I can easily write code snippets directly in the posts is something I
have long desired with WordPress. There are ways to do it in WP, but the
ReStructured Text format is familiar to me and is natural/intuitive.

Comments are not avaiable. I don't know if I will enable them again; there were
one or two useful comments out of the hundreds I received. I will most likely
use Hacker News/Reddit comments when I post new things going forward.

The theme is `tuxlite_tbs`_ from the `pelican-themes`_ repo.

The source is available on github: `thomasvandoren/blog.thomasvandoren.com`_. I
may move the site to github pages, but for now I'm leaving it on my host behind
`CloudFlare`_ and its awesome cache.
