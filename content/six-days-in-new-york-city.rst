I found a cheap mid-week flight to New York City a few weeks ago on
`Kayak`_. I have used Kayak fairly often in the last year or two, and I
have always been impressed! I am especially excited for the new `Hacker
Fares`_ feature.

Enough about Kayak, though, I will be in the Big Apple! I already have a
ticket to see `Follies`_ with Bernadette Peters on my first day. I also
have a list of potential drag shows and gay bars to visit. Needless to
say, this will be a vacation more of the adventure/extravaganza flavor
(rather than relaxing).

Suggestions are welcome and encouraged.
