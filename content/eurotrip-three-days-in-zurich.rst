I arrived in Zurich 21 hours after leaving Seattle. I took the train
from the airport which provided some pretty exciting views of Zurich.

I love the feeling in Zurich. The buildings are mostly old. The windows
all have shutters. There are lots of cobbled streets and narrow
walkways.

I stayed just south of downtown in a pretty touristy area. There is at
least a dozen night clubs/bars in the same block as my hostel. The
stores in the area are also fairly nice. It is hard to just window shop
with so many appealing products in the window...

Across the lake was a pretty ritzy part of town. From there, I walked
down the west side of the lake on a rainy morning and found lots of
elegant apartment buildings. It must cost a fortune to live there. It
cost me quite a bit just to eat in Zurich. A latte and croissant was 11
francs, which is about $12!

The attitude of the people reminds me of Seattle. They are a bit cold
and unwilling to engage.Â The other travelers that I met were very
interesting and engaging, though. I met people from Mexico, Lausanne
Switzerland, London, Brazil, and Russia. Saturday evening I went to one
of the local dance clubs with four guys from Laussanne. I left at 4:30
after dancing all night... I was not even close to the last person to
leave!

I found an Apple reseller (essentially an Apple Store) when I was
wandering around. The keyboards were surprising. They are QWERTZ
keyboards! The Z and the Y are switched. They have a different layout
for special characters.The surprising aspect is that these keyboards are
not very useful for programming. Clearly they are not meant for use with
the bash shell as the vertical bar, hash sign, curly braces, and square
brackets are missing! I suppose a programmer would use two keyboards...

Overall, I enjoyed my time in Zurich. I will get another
afternoon/evening there at the end of my trip. It is a beautiful place.
Though, I don't think I could visit more than a couple days without a
very large budget.
