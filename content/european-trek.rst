I have booked a trip to Europe at the end of Winter quarter! w00t!

I will be flying in and out of Zurich. I am hoping to travel to two or
three other countries during my 18 day adventure. I am considering
Florence, Italy; Barcelona, Spain; and Paris, France. I have also
considered Germany, Amsterdam, Prague, Greece, and Rome as possible
destinations. I would like to spend three to five days in each place.

All in all, I hope this trip will help me celebrate the culmination of
my academic career while providing new experiences in new cultures. I
had a great time in October when I got to spend four days in Torino,
Italy (photos below) and this trip promises to be even better.
