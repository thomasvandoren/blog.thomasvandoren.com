Paris was spectacular! The weather was a bit drizzly, but I did get one
full day of sunshine as I made my way through a four day whirlwind tour
of monuments and museums.

The first museum I visited was the Louvre. It is huge. I cannot believe
how big the building itself is! I spent several hours there, and it was
incredible. The Mona Lisa was flocked by tourists and heavily guarded. I
was surprised how many people were just flocking to the famous works
listed in the map...

I also went to the Musee d'Orsay. I was impressed with all of the work I
saw, but I found Monet's paintings particularly interesting. The clarity
of his painting (out of chaos) impressed me the most.

To keep my religious bearings, I visited Sainte Chapelle, Notre Dame,
and Sacré Coeur. They were all very impressive. The Sacré Coeur has a
pretty amazing view of Paris, especially at night.

The Eiffel Tower, the Arc de Triomphe, Champs-Élysées, and the catacombs
also got some of my time. The Eiffel Tower was an impressive piece of
architecture, but it seems a bit out of place compared to its
surroundings. The catacombs were very creepy! I could not believe how
many bones were down there. It definitely made me cringe.

All in all, Paris was a great experience. I feel like I got a quick
revue of the city and its culture (including the nightlife). But I will
have to return someday to see the many things I missed.
