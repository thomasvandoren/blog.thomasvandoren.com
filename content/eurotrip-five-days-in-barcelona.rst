I had an exciting five days in Barcelona. The weather was nice, the time
changed (to DST), I saw some great Gaudi buildings, and ate some amazing
food.

My hostel was located on the south side of the Eixample neighborhood, in
the middle of huge clothing stores and near La Rambla. La Rambla
(sometimes referred to as the plural Las Ramblas) is a long street full
of human statues and performers, souvenirs, restaurants, bars, and
animals. There are actually lizards, hamsters, and a variety of other
potential pet animals for sale right on the street! There seemed to be a
Zara on just about every other street corner. I guess it is quite
popular in Barcelona...

The Guadi buildings around the city are epic. There was one near my
hostel. The Barcelona Cathedral was also epic. It is full of beautiful
wood sculptures. The cathedral itself was rather dark, being that it is
all stone, but the details were what impressed me the most. I enjoyed
that it was stone and wood after seeing so many marble cathedrals in
Italy.

One afternoon I walked to the Parc de la Ciutadella. It is an incredibly
well kept park with ponds, fountains, and a maze of walking/running
paths. It was a great place to bask in the Spanish sun. Next to the park
is the Barcelona Zoo. It has been a long time since I have visited a
zoo, and I forgot how fun it could be. They had a Komodo Dragon. Its
tongue looked like it was a foot long!

The nightlife in Barcelona was quite different than anything I have ever
experienced before. People go out for drinks at midnight and then go
dancing at 3am. The sun was coming up when I left dance club on Sunday
morning... needless to say I slept through most of the morning and early
afternoon.

Overall I really enjoyed my time in Barcelona. I was able to see some
art and architecture, shop for trinkets, people watch, dance all night,
and eat Paella. I will probably have to visit again; I had a lot of fun.
