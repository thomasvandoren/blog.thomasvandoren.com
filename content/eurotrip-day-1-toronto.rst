After staying up all night celebrating the end of my academic career, I
was whisked to Toronto, Canada via Air Canada.

I had a six hour layover, which lead to an exploration of the Toronto
airport. Turns out Coyote Jacks Grill is a pretty good 'fast food'
concept. By American standards it is high quality fast food. I had a
burger on a croissant bun! I also discovered some of the art around the
airport before giving thanks for free wi-fi.

If everything goes well, I will be in Zurich early Friday morning!
