As I mentioned in an `earlier post`_, I will be traveling through Europe
in the latter part of March into early April. I considered going to
several places including Germany and Amsterdam, but ultimately I decided
to go with my original plan. So, Zurich, Florence, Barcelona, and Paris
are the final destinations.

Ultimately it came down to budget and time. I wanted to spend at least
three or four days in each city. I will be staying in hostels and
traveling on overnight trains. I should have some interesting
experiences. Without further ado, here it is:

-  **Mar-18 - Mar-20** Zurich, Switzerland
-  **Mar-21 - Mar-24** Florence, Italy
-  **Mar-25 - Mar-29** Barcelona, Spain
-  **Mar-30 - Apr-2** Paris, France
-  **Apr-3** Zurich, Switzerland
-  **Apr-4** Fly back to Seattle

I am planning to add blog posts throughout my trip, or at least brief
updates. I should have some sporadic internet access.

I am really excited to leave! It will be quite a relief after completing
school.
